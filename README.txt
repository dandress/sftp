USAGE

  There is no documentation yet besides the javadocs. But it is not complicated
  either. If you just want to use the client-side part create the control
  connection object, run selected() in your select() loop and execute your
  commands one by one after attaching listeners to them. If you need more or
  have other questions, contact the author.
